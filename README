This directory contains an implementation of Classp. Classp is a language for
declaring abstract syntax trees (ASTs) with a special formatting language that
automatically creates a formatter and parser for the AST. The language is
documented in the docs subdirectory.

The source code is in the src subdirectory. It builds with Bison 3.02 or later,
flex lex 2.5.39, and g++ 4.8.2. Cd to the directory and type

  make classp

This will create all intermediate and object files as well as the executable,
classp, in the srce directory. To run tests type

  make tests
